# Coffee-Riddle-Solver

Decided to solve the 538 Coffee Addiction riddler by running some simulations. The problem can be found here: 

The rules are that there is 1 coffee pot in the office and you want to get as much coffee as possible and don't want to refill the pot. Select a fraction of the total coffee pot's volume that you will attempt to pour in your mug. If you take the last bit of coffee you must refill the coffee pot, and are so angry about this that you break your mug and get no coffee at all. 

Figure out how much coffee you should take per trip to maximize the coffee you get over the course of several lifetimes in this office (thousands of simulations).
